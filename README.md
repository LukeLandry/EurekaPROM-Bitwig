This is a work in progress.  The goal is to be able to connect the 
Behringer FCB1010 foot controller with the EurekaPROM third party 
firmware replacement to turn effects on and off on guitar tracks, as well
as start and stop clip recording. No support is given, but feel free to fork
and mess with it.
